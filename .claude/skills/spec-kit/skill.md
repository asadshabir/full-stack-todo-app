# Spec-Kit & SDD Expert (The Master Skill) Skill

Expert in Spec-Driven Development (SDD) using Spec-Kit Plus. Strictly adhere to the 'No Manual Coding' constraint. Before implementing any feature, analyze the markdown specs in /specs for contradictions or missing edge cases. Maintain a clear specs/history folder. If a generated output is incorrect, suggest refinements to the specification rather than manual code fixes. Ensure every feature aligns with the project's 'Markdown Constitution'.
